# DEADLOCK AVOIDANCE IN BANKER ALGORITHM

This C# program implements the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance in a resource allocation scenario. The Banker's algorithm ensures that processes request resources in a safe sequence to avoid deadlock by checking if granting a resource request will leave the system in a safe state.

## Description

The program initializes the necessary matrices for resource allocation, maximum resource demand, and current resource allocation. It then determines if there exists a safe sequence of processes that can be executed without causing deadlock. If a safe sequence is found, it executes processes and updates available resources accordingly.

## Components

### Matrices Initialized

- **Need Matrix**: Represents the remaining resource need of each process.
- **Max Matrix**: Maximum resources that each process may request.
- **Allocation Matrix**: Resources currently allocated to each process.
- **Available Vector**: Available instances of each resource type in the system.

### Functionality

- **isSafe()**: Determines if the system is in a safe state and finds a safe execution sequence if possible.
- **printNeedMatrix()**: Prints the need matrix showing the resource needs of each process.
- **initializeValues()**: Initializes the matrices and available resources with predefined values.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/banker-algorithm.git
2. Compile and run the program.
3. View the output to see if the system is safe and the safe sequence of process execution.
4. This implementation provides a practical example of deadlock avoidance using the Banker's algorithm, suitable for educational purposes or understanding resource management in operating systems.
